# Building-Classification-Tree-

I implemented Classification Trees on the Banknote dataset, focusing on four main functions written from scratch in Python:

Gini Index Function: This function calculates the Gini impurity for a given set of data points.

Creating Split Function: This function determines the best split point for a dataset based on the Gini index.

Building a Tree Function: Using the previous functions, this function recursively builds a classification tree with a specified maximum depth and minimum data size in each node.

Making a Prediction Function: Finally, this function uses the constructed tree to make predictions for new data points.

I split the dataset into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%). Then, I trained a classification tree with a maximum depth of 5 and a minimum data size of 10 in each node. I reported the training and testing accuracy of the classification tree in my write-up.
